      <a href="https://bokunoheroacademia.fandom.com/wiki/Katsuki_Bakugo" target="_blank">Katsuki</a>   is a crude, arrogant, short-tempered, and aggressive person, especially at the beginning of the series. Katsuki tends to come off as an anti-hero,

        Quirkless Izuku Midoriya.

      As pointed out by many people, Katsuki loves to win above all else and cannot stand it when he doesn't, leading him to lose his already short temper or, less often, sulk</h2>
